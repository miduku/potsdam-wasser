# FastPlate
A Barebones Responsive SCSS Boilerplate to get started with [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell).
This Boilerplate is mobile-first ready, uses [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) and has been inspired by [Motherplate](https://github.com/leemunroe/motherplate).

## How to get started
1. Start your Project with [FastShell](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell).
	1. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/download), [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/tutorial.html) and [Git](http://git-scm.com/) on your machine. If you're a Windows user you'll also need to install [Ruby](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads).
	2. Install [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) using `npm install -g gulp`. You may need to use `sudo` in front of the Gulp install command to give it permissions.
	3. Fork/Clone/Download the FastShell repository into your machine, you should hopefully see all the files and folders. This is where we will copy the FirePlate files to.
2. Don't open Terminal and `npm install` yet.
3.  Fork/Clone/Download the **FastPlate** repository into your machine, then copy the **FastPlate** folders `app/` and `src/` into your projects root folder. All FastShell files and folders will be overwritten.
4. Open Terminal and type ``npm install`` to install dependencies.
5.  Now type ``gulp``.
6. Enjoy.
7. For more information read the [FastShell docs](https://github.com/HosseinKarami/fastshell/blob/master/DOCS.md).

### [Font Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) 4 integration
Before building your project, check `vendor/_external.scss`  in your `style.scss` if you want to use Font Awesome.

If not, remove it from your `style.scss` and delete `app/assets/fonts`.
